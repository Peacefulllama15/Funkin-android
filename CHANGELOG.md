CYE WEEKS V1.2

* Changed SongOne NORMAL to HARD and brought back the original NORMAL difficulty.
* Fixed the "Customize Gameplay" option in the Gameplay options.
- Removed "Offset Testing" option in the Gameplay Options (it was very broken).
+ Added Autoplay Mode. Enabling it will have the songs play themselves. It will not grant you the points at the end of the song/week nor unlock any other weeks.
+ (exclusive to 32-bits systems) Cye Intro no longer plays and has been replaced by a Cye Slidedshow.
